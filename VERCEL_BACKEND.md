# Deploying Backend to Vercel (Advanced)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This is not recommended for production WebSocket apps, but here's how if you need it.

## Why This is Tricky

1. Vercel serverless functions have **10-60 second execution limits**
2. WebSocket connections need to stay open for **minutes**
3. You'll need workarounds that add complexity

## Option 1: Vercel + External WebSocket Service

### Architecture

```
Widget ‚Üí Vercel API Routes ‚Üí Ably/Pusher ‚Üí Gemini
```

**Pros:**
- Everything on Vercel
- Managed WebSocket service

**Cons:**
- Additional cost ($29-49/month for Ably/Pusher)
- More complexity
- Still not ideal

### Setup

1. Sign up for Ably (https://ably.com) or Pusher
2. Use their WebSocket service
3. Your Vercel backend becomes API routes only

**Not recommended** - costs more than Railway!

---

## Option 2: Vercel Serverless + Polling (Hacky)

Replace WebSockets with HTTP polling:

```
Widget ‚Üí Poll every 500ms ‚Üí Vercel API ‚Üí Gemini
```

**Pros:**
- Works on Vercel free tier
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Laggy (500ms+ delay)
- High API costs (many requests)
- Poor user experience
- Not real-time

**Definitely not recommended** for voice chat!

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Backend API on Vercel + WebSocket on Railway:**

```
Widget ‚Üê‚Üí Railway (WebSocket only) ‚Üê‚Üí Vercel (API routes) ‚Üê‚Üí Gemini
```

**Pros:**
- Static files on Vercel (free)
- Just WebSocket on Railway ($5)

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Two deployments

### This could work if:
- You want Vercel's CDN for static assets
- You're okay with Railway for real-time

---

## Option 4: Vercel Edge Functions (Pro Plan)

Vercel Pro+ supports WebSockets in Edge Functions:

### Requirements

- Vercel Pro plan ($20/month)
- Use Edge Runtime
- Connection limits apply

### Setup

```javascript
// api/socket.js
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

export default async function handler(req) {
  if (req.headers.get('upgrade') === 'websocket') {
    // Handle WebSocket
    // Limited duration!
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Everything on Vercel
- Edge network (fast)

**Cons:**
- $20/month (vs Railway $5/month)
- Connection duration limits
- Not designed for long-lived connections

## üéØ Honest Recommendation

**Don't deploy backend to Vercel.** Here's why:

| Platform | Best For | Cost | WebSocket |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Vercel** | Static sites, API routes | Free-$20 | Limited |
| **Railway** | WebSocket servers | $5 | Excellent ‚úÖ |
| **Render** | Full-stack apps | Free-$7 | Excellent ‚úÖ |

**Use each platform for what it's best at:**
- Vercel: Frontend widget (FREE)
- Railway: Backend WebSocket ($5)

**Total: $5/month for perfect setup**

vs.

**Vercel only: $20/month for limited setup**

---

## But I Really Want Vercel Only!

If you absolutely must:

### Simplest: Use REST API Only (No Voice)

Remove WebSockets entirely:

1. Text-only chat
2. HTTP POST requests
3. No real-time voice
4. Works perfectly on Vercel free tier

This works great for **text chat**, but you lose:
- ‚ùå Real-time voice
- ‚ùå Streaming responses
- ‚ùå Low latency

### Code Changes Needed

```javascript
// Instead of WebSocket
fetch('https://your-app.vercel.app/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello' })
});
```

This would work, but defeats the purpose of **real-time voice agent**.

---

## üí° The Truth

Vercel is **amazing** for:
- Static sites
- Next.js apps
- API routes
- Edge functions

But it's **not designed** for:
- Long-lived connections
- WebSocket servers
- Real-time streaming
- Always-on backends

That's why you need Railway/Render for the backend.

---

## Final Comparison

### All Vercel (Forced)

**Setup:**
- Widget: Vercel
- Backend: Vercel Pro + Ably WebSocket service

**Cost:**
- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- Ably: $29/month
- **Total: $49/month**

**Experience:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (okay, but not great)

### Recommended (Vercel + Railway)

**Setup:**
- Widget: Vercel (free)
- Backend: Railway

**Cost:**
- Vercel: $0
- Railway: $5/month
- **Total: $5/month**

**Experience:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (perfect)

---

## TL;DR

**Can you?** Yes, with workarounds
**Should you?** No
**Why not?** Costs 10x more, works worse
**Better option?** Railway ($5) + Vercel (free)

Vercel is for **static content and APIs**.
Railway is for **WebSockets and real-time**.

Use the right tool for the job! üõ†Ô∏è
