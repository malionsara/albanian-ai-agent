   - Albanian language support
   - Session management

2. **Frontend Widget**
   - Clean, modern chat interface
   - Text input/output
   - Voice recording capability
   - Real-time responses
   - Embeddable design

3. **Core Features**
   - Text chat with AI in Albanian
   - Basic voice input (captured)

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps (Do These First!)

### 1. Get It Running (5 minutes)

```bash
# Get your API key
# Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

# Add to backend/.env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Start it!
# Option A: Use the start.bat script (Windows)
start.bat

# Option B: Manual start (2 terminals)
cd backend && npm run dev
cd widget && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Albanian Conversations (10 minutes)

Open http://localhost:5173 and try:

```
"PÃ«rshÃ«ndetje! Si je?"
"Ã‡farÃ« mund tÃ« bÃ«sh?"
"MÃ« trego pÃ«r veten tÃ«nde"
"A mund tÃ« mÃ« ndihmosh me njÃ« problem?"
```

### 3. Test the Voice Quality (5 minutes)

- Listen to the TTS responses
- Check if Albanian pronunciation is acceptable
- Note: It's using basic browser TTS for now

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Enhance Voice Quality (Week 1-2)

### Priority: Better Albanian TTS

**Current:** Browser's Web Speech API (limited Albanian voices)

**Goal:** Google Cloud Text-to-Speech with high-quality Albanian voices

**Steps:**
1. Enable Google Cloud TTS API
2. Get available Albanian voices (sq-AL)
3. Integrate into backend
4. Stream audio back to widget
5. Replace Web Speech API with audio player

**Expected Improvement:**
- Much better Albanian pronunciation
- More natural sounding
- Consistent quality across browsers

### Add Real Speech-to-Text

**Current:** Audio captured but not processed

**Goal:** Convert voice to text using Google Cloud STT

**Steps:**
1. Enable Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
2. Add audio processing to backend
3. Stream audio chunks from widget
4. Convert to text
5. Send to Gemini

**Cost:** ~$0.024/minute (cheaper than ElevenLabs!)

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: Phone Integration (Week 3-4)

### Add Twilio for Phone Calls

**Goal:** Let the AI answer real phone calls

**Components Needed:**
1. Twilio account + phone number
2. ConversationRelay integration
3. Call routing logic
4. Call recording (optional)
5. Call analytics

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for Twilio (get $15 free credit)
2. Buy a phone number (~$1/month)
3. Set up ConversationRelay webhook
4. Connect to your WebSocket server
5. Test incoming calls

**User Experience:**
```
Customer calls â†’ Twilio number â†’ Your backend â†’ Gemini â†’ Response
```

**Cost per call:**
- Twilio: ~$0.013/minute
- Gemini: ~$0.025/minute
- **Total: ~$0.04/minute** (vs. ElevenLabs $0.06-0.10)

   - Start self-service, add sales for Enterprise

3. **Free tier?**
   - Yes! 100 minutes/month to test
   - Good for marketing

4. **Which features first?**
   - Priority: Better TTS > Phone > Dashboard

5. **Open source or closed?**
   - Keep core closed, open-source widget for trust
